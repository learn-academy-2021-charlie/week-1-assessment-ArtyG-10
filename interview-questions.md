# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer:
    A function is a self-contained block of code which is is reusable and can be run with different inputs. The function takes a parameter as an input and then modifies the input to whatever the function was written to do and then returns the output. It is useful because it can be reused and run multiple times.

  Researched answer:
    Functions are blocks of code that perform particular tasks and execute only when invoked at which point they take the argument which is optional information passed in to the function and execute the code and return the output value. It is fundamental to Javascript because you can reuse the same code as many times as you want with different arguments, producing different results.


2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer:
    A parameter is the data which is input into the function. The purpose of the parameter is that you can have the function perform what you need it to do with not just one bit of data but whatever you choose to input. I am not sure what an argument is in regards to a function.
  Researched answer:
    After some research I found that my definition for a parameter is actually what the argument is. The argument is the actual data -recognizable by Javascript- which is input into and read by the function. In contrast the argument is just the placeholder which is used in writing the function. The argument is undefined until it is assigned a specific value when the function is called, at which point JavaScript inputs it into the function as a parameter.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:
    An index calls forth a value from either a string or array. It starts counting from [0] which means that the first index is the second value.

  Researched answer:
    An index is a property which indicates the placement of a character in a string, or the elements in an array. The first element is always [0] and the last can be found by the index value equal to the array's length property minus 1.


4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer:
    A built-in method is a tool which is incorporated into javascript which lets you manipulate data in helpful ways. An example is is the .length method which gives you the length of a string.

  Researched answer:
    A built-in method is a functionality of the Javascript language which can only be run on "strings" as they rely on properties innate to the string datatype. Some built-in methods do not take any further information and others require an argument which goes in parenthesis next to the name.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
    In par programming you have a driver and a navigator. While both talk through the work the driver is in charge of typing out the code and the navigator is in charge of steering the driver in the right direction. For example the navigator will do research when they get stuck and is looking out for any typing errors which are made.

  Researched answer:
    Pair programing is used to distribute the cognitive load and make coding feel less overwhelming. The driver shares their screen and is focused on typing syntax. The navigator is in constant communication with the driver and gives instructions to the driver on what problem solving approach to take. They will switch roles approximately every 25 minutes.   


6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:
    I did not realize how helpful pair programming and working as a team in coding was until I had to work individually and saw how much of a struggle that can be! Two pairs of eyes on a program really does make a difference in the rate of work you can accomplish.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: Iteration is when a program repeats a task for however many times you specify. These tasks are called loops and each time the loop is repeated it is a new iteration of itself.

2. Higher Order Functions: A type of function that calls another function in the argument or outputs a function in the return.

3. Jest: Jest is used to create, run, and structure tests that check your code to your expectations. An example of a simple test you can run is checking that the output for a certain set of inputs is what you expect it to be.  

4. Classes: Classes are special type of functions that serve as a template for creating objects. Just like regular functions they need to have a declaration and expression. Classes are PascalCased instead of camelCased.

5. React: A Javascript library which is used to build interfaces such as webpages, mobile webpages, and apps. It lets you create complex user interfaces from small and isolated bits of code called components.
